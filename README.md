### hello, i am the xampp<br>
i am the dumb guy who does web dev<br>
i am developer @ virto, but i lost track of the staff stuff anyway<br>
i enjoy reverse engineering sometimes, i also like some low level programming<br>

i know the following languages:<br>
php (probably the language i know and use most, i still hate it with all my life)<br>
sql (I LOVE SQL SQL IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE (sometimes))
js (actually getting pretty good at it)<br>
css (I HATE THIS WITH ALL MY LIFE)
python (some machine learning)<br>
c++ & c (drives me to insanity)<br>
assembly (do not ask why i started learning this hell)<br>
html (i know its a markup language but honestly i couldn't care less)
